      "Sosoru is a luxe Japandi-themed bar and restaurant that blends minimalist Japanese aesthetics with Scandinavian warmth. The space features a rich palette of natural wood, clean lines, and earthy textures. A signature highlight is the custom-designed bar counter that anchors the space, accompanied by a live kitchen that adds an interactive dimension to the dining experience. Multiple distinct seating zones‚Äîeach curated for ambiance and comfort‚Äîoffer varied experiences within the same envelope. The open layout frames scenic views and lies on the Old Mussoorie Road in Dehradun, enhancing the sensory journey.",
      " Designing Sosoru was a creatively fulfilling experience. Spread across approximately 7,000‚Äì10,000 square feet, the scale allowed for layered experimentation with textures, finishes, and spatial zoning. The project gave us the rare opportunity to play extensively with materials‚Äîespecially wood‚Äîboth structurally and aesthetically. Our team crafted custom carpentry and refined paint techniques inspired by traditional Japanese palettes. Open ceiling conduits added a subtle industrial edge, juxtaposed with warm elements for balance. From out-of-the-box detailing to thematic blending, every decision was made to preserve the spirit of Japandi while tailoring it to an elevated dining context in the hills.",

This flagship store was reimagined inside-out to reflect both tradition and modern indulgence.

A warm, inviting corner entry with marble textures and a neon glow sets the tone for what lies inside.",
      "The interiors are a blend of industrial charm and contemporary elegance. With exposed wooden ceiling beams, copper-toned chandeliers, and black-and-white striped flooring, the store radiates a rhythmic warmth. Display units were custom-designed for both visibility and function, with an emphasis on baked goods as the centerpiece. From biscuit baskets to cake counters, the layout ensures an intuitive and aesthetic browsing experience. This project wasn‚Äôt just a makeover‚Äîit was a brand revival designed to stand out and stay timeless.",

      "Goa LUX is a 5,000-square-meter heritage homestay project located in Loutolim, South Goa, where Indo- Portuguese legacy meets refined luxury. At its heart lies a 300-year-old Portuguese villa, originally built over 400 sqm, now meticulously redesigned and expanded into a 1,200 sqm estate that honors its past while embracing contemporary comfort. The structure was sensitively reimagined into a boutique homestay featuring multiple public and semi-public spaces, including grand dining areas, sit-outs, and balconies, all designed with experiential hospitality in mind.",
      "The layout comprises large luxury rooms with walk-in closets and opulent bathrooms fitted with jacuzzis. True to its roots, the design retains original elements like arched windows, decorative columns, red-tiled sloping roofs, and stucco-finished fa√ßades. Every architectural decision‚Äîfrom the scalloped balustrades to the intricate balconies‚Äîdraws inspiration from Portuguese-era details and harmonizes with modern architectural sensibilities.",

      "Galaxy Hospital is a full-scale healthcare design transformation project located at Kargi Chowk on Haridwar Road, Dehradun. What began as a basic grey structure was reimagined into a fully functioning, multi-specialty hospital that reflects both architectural clarity and healing warmth. Our role encompassed complete design and execution‚Äîfrom fa√ßade development to interiors of every critical zone within the facility",
      "The hospital fa√ßade was articulated using terracotta brick tiles and vertical glass bands, creating a rhythm of earthy materiality and transparency. The bold linear signage band integrates clean branding with contextual form. Internally, we designed everything from executive suites and OPD clinics to general wards and waiting lounges. Each space was curated to provide comfort, functionality, and spatial hygiene.",
      " One of the most defining features is the central atrium‚Äîa vertical spine that extends through all seven floors, capped by a rooftop skylight that floods the space with natural light. The atrium wall carries a bespoke vertical feature design that draws the eye upward, creating a sense of openness and elevation. Adjacent to it lies the hospital caf√©, designed with warm wood tones, subtle brass detailing, and a beautifully hand- crafted dome ceiling made of cane and bamboo‚Äîoffering a unique juxtaposition of natural texture within a clinical space. ",
      "Partitions in the caf√© were designed using wooden frameworks to subtly divide space while preserving openness. Lighting strategy across the hospital plays a key role in enhancing wayfinding and calming the overall ambiance. Functional zones are clearly demarcated, but the design maintains continuity through consistent material usage and tone balancing",
      " Delivered in 2025, Galaxy Hospital is not just a medical infrastructure‚Äîit is a testament to how healthcare spaces can be elevated into calm, healing environments through sensitive architecture and thoughtful execution.",

A compact yet functional servant quarter was also integrated, maintaining privacy and utility without compromising the apartment’s seamless flow.",
